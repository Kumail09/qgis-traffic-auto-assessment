Welcome to Qgis-Auto-Traffic-Assessment documentation!
===================================



Belgium consists of 3 regions: Vlaanderen (VL), Wallonia (WL) and Brussels (BXL).
Each have their own maps.
The goal is to make maps for Belgium - Vlaanderen aka VL as version 1.0. We
will not take Brussels
aka BXL nor
Wallonie aka WL into consideration.
However, for bus and bike networks, we sometimes need information
that belongs to the
other regions if the coordinates are close to the border of the regions.
This is because the networks are not limited to the border lines of the regions.
Train is a continuous network for the whole country.

Check out the :doc:`structure` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
